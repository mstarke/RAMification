# RAMification

A Tool to manage RAM disks.

## ATTENTION

This is a small pet project and in no way finished. I'm working on it on a very irregular basis and the current code if far from complete.

## Features

Not all Features are implemented yet.

### Core Freatures

* create, mount and unmount a default RAM disk
* optionally disable Unified Media Buffer on RAM disks to reduce memory footprint
* autolaunch on login

### Favourite Management

* create, mount and unmount favourites
* manage favourites (volume name, size, backup mode, automount on launch)
* automount favourites
* autosync favourites (backup on unmount, restore on mount, etc. )
* autoresize favourites (currently unsupported)
* autorename favourites based on file system activity
* block unmounting of favourites without (configured) backups
* customize icons for each ramdisk
